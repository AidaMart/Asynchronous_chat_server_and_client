# Asynchronous_chat_server_and_client

The purpose of the project is to create Server and Client chat, where clients can connect to one server and can communicate with each other in real time. Here you can find server.py and client.py files which include the functionalities of the project. You can use this link https://youtu.be/TGoj1LEfu_c to watch the video demonstration of the project. In the video, I connected the server and created three different clients. After successfully connecting to the server, first two clients send messages to each other, the third client sends direct message to the first client. Also, for testing the cases what happens if the user disconnects from the server and if server becomes disconnected, I intentionally disconnect some clients and the server in the end of the video. Enjoy!
